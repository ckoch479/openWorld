openWorld is a 3D game engine I have been working on in my spare time as a passion project.
Over the span of a couple years I have been teaching myself C++ and well as alot of commonly used mathematics in game development.
Some files in this project are a result of my ongoing learning. 
This is an ongoing project that I hope to continue to improve as I learn more about programming and game development as a whole.

I used various sources to learn from while putting this together such as:
  websites: 
  https://learnopengl.com/ 
  https://ogldev.org/
  https://chatgpt.com/
  
  Physical Media: 
  C++ for dummies by Jon Paul Mueller
  Game Engine Architecture third edition by Jason Gregory


libraries used: C++, GLFW, glm, Assimp, stb_image, reactPhysics3d.

Models, animations, and textures were provided from mixamo and sketchfab. These assets are for testing and will not be used permanently.
